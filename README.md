langid
======

A demo version of a language identifier using trigram statistics.

Currently most text written to the console is in Hungarian.

The training files are the respective Wikipedia articles 'dog' for each language.
If the article was too short, I also added another one about the countries capital.

## Upcoming features

1. Reading from stdin and identifying language for each line.
2. Change texts and filenames to English from Hungarian.
